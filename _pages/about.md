Hello! Welcome to my website. I am an astronomy postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toledo. I completed my Ph.D. in astronomy from Columbia University in 2021. 

I primarily study the formation of the first stars in the universe using numerical simulations. 

Please bear with me while I tidy up this website.
