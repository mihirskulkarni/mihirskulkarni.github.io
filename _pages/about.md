Hello! Welcome to my website. I am an astronomy postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toledo. I completed my Ph.D. in astronomy from Columbia University in 2021. 

I study the formation of the first stars in the universe using numerical simulations and semi-analytical models. I am also interested in alternative dark mattter models, particularly fuzzy dark matter which is made up of ultra-light axions ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV) where the quantum effects of the particle manifest on the astrophysical scales.
