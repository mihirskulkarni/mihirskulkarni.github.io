Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy at the University of Toledo. I completed my Ph.D. in astronomy from Columbia University in 2021. I completed my undergrad (B.S.-M.S. dual degree) from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune in 2015.

I study the formation of the first stars in the universe using numerical simulations and semi-analytical models. I am also interested in alternative dark mattter models, particularly fuzzy dark matter which is made up of ultra-light axions ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV) where the quantum nature of the particles manifests on the astrophysical scales.
